# Materialish
Material like CSS styles
## About
I have grown tired of rewriting a material card every time I build a new site, so
I have taken my 'material' like CSS styles and coalesced them into one file.
## Usage
Add the following line to your ```<head>```

```
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css" media="screen" title="no title" charset="utf-8">
```
## Documentation
Will write documentation later
